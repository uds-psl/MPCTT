Implicit Types (n x y: nat) (a: nat * nat).

Definition next a : nat * nat :=
  match a with

  | (S x, y) => (x, S y)
  end.

Fixpoint decode n : nat * nat :=

Fact encode_next a :
  encode (next a) = S (encode a).
Proof.
  destruct a as [[|x] y]; cbn.
  - replace (y + 0) with y; lia.
  - replace (x + S y) with (S (x + y)); cbn; lia.

Opaque encode.
(* Disables simplification of encode;
   doesn't affect reflexivity and easy. *)

Fact encode_decode n :
  encode (decode n) = n.
Proof.
  induction n as [|n IH]; cbn.
  - reflexivity.
  - rewrite encode_next. congruence.
